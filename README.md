# ROUNDTABLE NLE v0.13

**GPU-accelerated non-linear video editor — built for Spine animation workflows.**

ROUNDTABLE is a full-featured NLE written in C++20 with Vulkan 1.3 compute shaders and Qt 6. It combines professional-grade editing with native Spine animation compositing, AI-powered script-to-audio synchronization, real-time audio mixing, and hardware-accelerated export — purpose-built for creators working with 2D character animation and talking-head content.

## Download

The easiest way to get ROUNDTABLE is to download a pre-built installer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ROUNDTABLE-TALK/roundtable/releases). The installer is a portable Windows build — no dependencies, no package managers, no build steps. Just run the installer and launch.

```powershell
# After installation, launch from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut
```

## Building from Source

If you want to build the latest development version yourself (requires a dev environment):

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (C++ Desktop workload)
- Git
- Python 3.x

> No Vulkan SDK, CUDA Toolkit, or package manager required. All C++ dependencies are fetched by CMake. Qt 6.8.3 is installed locally by the setup script.

### One-Time Setup → Build → Run
```powershell
.\setup.bat      # Downloads Qt + shader compiler, configures CMake
.\build.bat      # Builds Release (takes a few minutes on first run)
.\launch.bat     # Launches ROUNDTABLE (no console window)
```

### Manual Build
```powershell
cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ^
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="third_party/qt/6.8.3/msvc2022_64"
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
.\launch.bat
```

### Run Tests
```powershell
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Portable / Move to Another Machine
1. Copy the entire folder (delete `build/` to save space)
2. Install VS2022, Git, Python 3
3. `setup.bat` → `build.bat` → `launch.bat`

### 🔊 Audio
- Real-time mixer via PortAudio (WASAPI exclusive-mode, <5 ms latency)
- Per-track volume, pan, solo/mute with VU metering
- SoundTouch time-stretching for pitch-preserved speed changes
- Audio-driven A/V sync — the audio callback is the master clock
- Waveform caching with compact binary disk format
- AudioSync: context menus, auto-match improvements, script session management

### 🤖 AI Script Sync
- GPU-accelerated speech-to-text via whisper.cpp (models from Tiny to Large V3)
- Script parser supporting plain text, HTML/Google Docs, and JSON formats
- Fuzzy script-to-audio matching with sequential bias and timecode awareness
- Raw content persistence for reliable multi-session workflows
- Automatically aligns transcribed dialogue to your script — ideal for talk shows, interviews, and voiceover work

### 📦 Export
- H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1, ProRes, DNxHR, Image Sequence
- NVENC hardware acceleration
- Smart render / packet passthrough when source matches export settings
- Audio mixdown with full effects processing

### 💾 Project Management
- `.rtp` project files with custom binary serialization
- Auto-save: timestamped copies in "Roundtable Auto-Save" folder (max 20, configurable)
- Crash recovery on next launch
- Relink Media dialog for moved/missing assets
- Recent files, project bin with thumbnails

### ⚡ GPU Pipeline
- Vulkan 1.3 compute shaders for compositing, effects, and transitions
- Optional CUDA for NVDEC hardware decoding / NVENC hardware encoding
- Disk frame cache (binary format) for decoded frame reuse across sessions
- Staging ring buffer for efficient CPU ↔ GPU transfers

## Workflow Overview

1. **Create or open a project** — `.rtp` files store all timeline, media, and effect state
2. **Import media** via the Project Bin — video, audio, images, Spine character files (.json + .atlas)
3. **Build your timeline** — drag clips onto the multi-track timeline, arrange with ripple/insert editing
4. **Compose Spine scenes** — use the Shot Composer to lay out multi-character animations with presets
5. **Apply effects & transitions** — drag from the Effects panel; keyframe parameters with bezier curves
6. **Sync audio to script** — transcribe with whisper.cpp, then run script matching to align dialogue
7. **Mix audio** — adjust per-track volume, pan, solo/mute with real-time VU feedback
8. **Export** — choose format and resolution; NVENC acceleration where available
