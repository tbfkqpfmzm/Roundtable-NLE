/*
 * PrefetchTexturePool — recycled VkImage pool for the GPU-resident prefetch
 * decode path (UPGRADE_PLAN Phase 3).
 *
 * Why this exists: every frame produced by the new convertDecodedToCacheGpu
 * (Phase 4) needs its own destination VkImage so the compositor can sample
 * it later. vmaCreateImage costs ~0.3-1 ms each and fragments VRAM under
 * sustained scrubbing. This pool recycles destroyed-but-not-freed Textures
 * keyed by (w, h, format, usage), mirroring the pattern already in
 * GpuUploadManager::m_texPool.
 *
 * Thread safety: all public methods take an internal mutex. The pool is
 * accessed by prefetch worker threads (multiple) and by the compositor
 * thread (release via shared_ptr deleter, when GpuTextureCache evicts a
 * Phase-5 shared entry).
 *
 * Capacity: kMaxPerShape = 16 (vs GpuUploadManager's 8). Prefetch produces
 * frames sequentially at up to ~30 fps, and PREFETCH_AHEAD_COUNT is 60.
 * 16 per shape avoids churn during cold scroll; the actual VRAM cost is
 * dominated by GpuTextureCache entries, not pool reserve.

    //    recycled-texture cap).
    //  - Bumped to 64 on 2026-05-22 to absorb steady-state eviction rate
    //    of the (then unbounded) GPU-resident decode path, where ~100 fps
    //    decode + multi-GB caches meant the cap-16 pool overflowed every
    //    frame and destroyed ~30 textures/sec — ~150-300 ms/sec of
    //    vmaDestroyImage on the prefetch worker, sustained stutter at
    //    the 30-60s mark.
    //  - REDUCED to 24 on 2026-05-22 v3 (UPGRADE_PLAN: Premiere-style
    //    bounded working set).  With GpuTextureCache + FrameCache both
    //    capped at small absolute entry counts (~180 / 360 on a 24 GB
    //    card), the eviction rate is much lower in steady state and
    //    64-per-shape reserve was just held-but-unused VRAM (~512 MB
    //    per shape).  24 = PREFETCH_AHEAD_COUNT (12) × 2, enough to
    //    absorb scrub-burst overshoot without overflow.  ~192 MB per
    //    shape at 1080p BGRA — fits any GPU.

// ── Helper: create-or-acquire a pooled Texture wrapped in a shared_ptr ──
//
// On call: tries pool.acquire(); on miss, creates a fresh Texture via
// Texture::create(). On success, returns a shared_ptr<Texture> whose
// custom deleter returns the Texture to `pool` instead of destroying it.
// Returns nullptr on Vulkan allocation failure.
//
// `concurrentQueueFamilies` is forwarded into TextureConfig — pass
// {computeFamily, graphicsFamily} so the resulting image uses
// VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT and can be written by the prefetch worker's
// compute submission and sampled by the compositor's graphics submission
// without an explicit queue-ownership-transfer barrier.
//
// Lifetime invariant: `pool` must outlive every shared_ptr<Texture>
// returned.  MediaPool owns the pool and ALL containers that hold the
// returned shared_ptrs (via CachedFrame::gpuTextureOwner):
//   • FrameCache       (m_cache)
//   • DiskFrameCache   (m_diskCache, including its write-behind queue
//                       drained on the writer thread during shutdown)
//   • GpuTextureCache  (held by CompositeEngine, not by MediaPool — but
//                       cleared in CompositeService::shutdown(), which
//                       App.cpp invokes before MediaPool is destroyed)
//
// MediaPool's member layout puts m_prefetchTexPool BEFORE m_cache and
// m_diskCache so reverse-order destruction destroys the pool LAST,
// after every shared_ptr<Texture> it ever issued has been released.
// See the DECLARATION-ORDER NOTE in MediaPool.h.
