 * MediaPoolPrefetchGpu.h — Vulkan-aware helpers for the GPU-resident

 * Kept in its own header so the broader prefetch translation units
 * (MediaPoolPrefetchSchedule.cpp, MediaPoolPrefetchDecode.cpp, etc.)
 * are not forced to pull in Vulkan headers — only the two TUs that
 * actually touch GPU state (MediaPoolPrefetchSchedule.cpp for per-worker
 * lifecycle, MediaPoolPrefetchConvertGpu.cpp for the convert + copy
 * pipeline) include this.
