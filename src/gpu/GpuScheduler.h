/*
 * GpuScheduler — Central authority for all vkQueueSubmit calls.
 *
 * P1 of CLAUDE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.  The single most important
 * architectural change for stability: no other code in the project
 * should call vkQueueSubmit directly.
 *
 * Why centralize?
 *
 *   Until P1, 24 files independently called vkQueueSubmit.  Each
 *   subsystem held its own VkQueue handle and submitted whenever
 *   it pleased.  Queue mutexes were owned ad-hoc; some callers
 *   acquired them, others didn't.  Cross-queue dependencies were
 *   ad-hoc (vkQueueWaitIdle sledgehammers, or worse, nothing).
 *   The May 2026 SpineRenderer cross-queue TDR was one symptom of
 *   this pattern: every fix is a per-caller patch instead of a
 *   structural guarantee.
 *
 *   After P1, every command-buffer submission flows through this
 *   class.  External synchronization on each VkQueue is enforced
 *   here, in one place, by a per-queue mutex held by GpuContext.
 *   Cross-queue dependencies are expressed via semaphores attached
 *   to GpuSubmission — never by callers calling vkQueueWaitIdle.
 *
 * v1 design (this revision):
 *
 *   submit() is synchronous.  The vkQueueSubmit happens on the
 *   calling thread, under the appropriate queue mutex held by
 *   GpuContext.  This is intentionally simple: the goal of v1 is
 *   consolidation, not threading rework.
 *
 *   Future revisions will spawn one dedicated thread per VkQueue
 *   and turn submit() into a non-blocking enqueue.  That belongs
 *   in a later P1.x once every caller is routed through here and
 *   the API has stabilized.
 *
 * Migration policy:
 *
 *   - New code: always submit via GpuScheduler::submit().
 *   - Existing call sites are migrated incrementally; the eventual
 *     end state is a build-time guard that #defines vkQueueSubmit
 *     to a compile error in non-scheduler TUs.  Not yet enforced.
